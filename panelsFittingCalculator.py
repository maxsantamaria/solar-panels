    a roof of the specified dimensions.

    one row (horizontally) and in one column (vertically). We then
    multiply both of these numbers to get the number of panels that
    we can place next to each other on the roof while maintaining
    the same panel rotation. Lastly, we calculate how many
    90Â°-rotated-panels we can place on the remaining space and
